    <h2>History of Kolhapur</h2>

    <details>
      <summary>🏛️ Ancient Period</summary>
      <p>
        Kolhapur is referred to as Karuvir or Dakshin Kashi in Hindu mythology. 
        The Skanda Purana describes Kolhapur as the abode of Goddess Mahalaxmi (Ambabai), making it a major religious center since ancient times. 
        Archaeological findings suggest Kolhapur’s civilization dates back to at least 200 BCE, with evidence of trade and settlements. 
        The city was an important stop on the ancient trade routes that connected coastal Konkan ports with the Deccan Plateau.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>⚔️ Medieval Era</summary>
      <p>
        Under the Shilahara Dynasty (940–1212 CE), Kolhapur rose to prominence as a capital city. 
        Rulers like Gandaraditya Shilahara contributed to temple construction, including portions of the Mahalaxmi Temple. 
        Later, the Yadavas of Devagiri (12th–13th century CE), under kings like Singhana II, brought Kolhapur under their influence. 
        During expansions of the Delhi Sultanate and Bahmani Sultanate, Kolhapur remained a contested but culturally resilient city, guarded by local chieftains and temple authorities.

    <details>
      <summary>🦁 Maratha Period</summary>
      <p>
        In the 17th century, Kolhapur gained importance under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who often used Panhala Fort as a strategic stronghold. 
        The legendary Baji Prabhu Deshpande fought the heroic Battle of Pavan Khind (1660) near Kolhapur, securing Shivaji’s escape. 
        After Shivaji’s death, succession disputes created two royal seats: Satara (main line of Shivaji) and Kolhapur (younger branch of the Bhosale dynasty). 
        In 1710, Kolhapur State was formally established as a Maratha princely state, led by descendants like Chhatrapati Shahu I of Kolhapur.

    <details>
      <summary>👑 Shahu Maharaj & Reforms</summary>
      <p>
        The most celebrated ruler of Kolhapur was Chhatrapati Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj (1874–1922). 
        He became a pioneer of social justice, free education, and upliftment of marginalized communities. 
        He was influenced by reformers like Jyotirao Phule, and in turn, inspired later leaders such as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. 
        Shahu Maharaj also popularized wrestling (Kushti) and supported industrialization, leaving a permanent mark on Kolhapur’s progressive identity.

      <summary>🇮🇳 Colonial & Modern Era</summary>
      <p>
        During British rule, Kolhapur remained a princely state under the Bhosale dynasty, allied with the Crown but internally autonomous. 
        Leaders like Chhatrapati Shahaji II (1874–1922, contemporary with Rajarshi Shahu) maintained royal traditions alongside reforms. 
        After India’s independence in 1947, Kolhapur merged into the Indian Union. 
        With the formation of Maharashtra in 1960, Kolhapur became a district headquarters and grew into a hub for sugar production, automobile industries, wrestling, and arts.
