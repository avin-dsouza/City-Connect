    <h2>About Kolhapur</h2>
    <p>
      Kolhapur, known as the Dakshin Kashi (Varanasi of the South), has a glorious history deeply rooted in spirituality and valor. 
      It is home to the Mahalaxmi Temple, one of the Shakti Peethas, attracting devotees for centuries. 
      The city was an important seat of the Maratha Empire, ruled by Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, a visionary leader who pioneered social reforms and education. 
      Rich traditions of wrestling (kushti), classical arts, and unique crafts like Kolhapuri chappals and jewelry also reflect its cultural pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modern Kolhapur is a vibrant blend of heritage and development. 
      It is known as the Sugar Bowl of Maharashtra due to its thriving sugar industry, while also being a hub for automobile and foundry industries. 
      The city offers a lively food culture, especially the spicy Kolhapuri cuisine, famous across India. 
      With improved infrastructure, Kolhapur has grown into a modern city while retaining its traditional warmth—making it a unique destination for both pilgrims and travelers.
