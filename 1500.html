  <h1>Kolhapur in the 1500s</h1>
  <p>
    During the early 1500s, Kolhapur was mentioned in Puranas and epics as Karvir.  
    It remained an important religious and cultural place, especially due to the Mahalaxmi Temple.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Trade routes connecting coastal Konkan and the Deccan plateau continued to pass through Kolhapur.
