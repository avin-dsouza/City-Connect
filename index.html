  <h2>History of Kolhapur</h2>

  <details open>
    <summary>🏛️ Ancient Period</summary>
    <p>
      Kolhapur is also called Karuvir or Dakshin Kashi in Hindu stories. 
      The Skanda Purana says Kolhapur is the home of Mahakali (Mahalaxmi), 
      which made it a holy city since very old times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archaeologists found that people lived here from at least 200 BCE. 
      It was also an important stop for trade between Konkan and the Deccan Plateau.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>⚔️ Medieval Era</summary>
    <p>
      From 940–1212 CE, Kolhapur grew under the Shilahara kings, 
      who built temples like parts of the Mahalaxmi Temple. 
      Later, the Yadavas of Devagiri ruled here.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, Kolhapur was influenced by the Delhi Sultanate 
      and Bahmani Sultanate, though local rulers kept some control.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>🦁 Maratha Period</summary>
    <p>
      In the 1600s, Kolhapur became important under 
      Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the Maratha Empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Shivaji’s death, two royal seats were formed: 
      Satara (main line) and Kolhapur (younger branch). 
      In 1710, Kolhapur State was officially created.
    </p>

    <summary>👑 Shahu Maharaj & Reforms</summary>
    <p>
      The most famous ruler of Kolhapur was 
      Chhatrapati Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj (1874–1922). 
      He worked for social justice, education, 
      and equality for all people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He promoted wrestling (Kushti), 
      supported industries, and built the base for modern Kolhapur.
    </p>

  <details>
    <summary>🇮🇳 Colonial & Modern Era</summary>

      During British rule, Kolhapur was a princely state. 
      After 1947, it became part of India.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1960, after Maharashtra state was formed, 
      Kolhapur became a district headquarters.
