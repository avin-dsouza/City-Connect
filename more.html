        is one of the most significant cultural and historic cities of the region. Often referred to as 
        <strong>Dakshin Kashi (Kashi of the South)</strong> or <em>Mahateerth</em>, it is known for its 
        spiritual heritage, vibrant culture, and unique cuisine. The city’s identity is also tied to its

      <h2>🏛️ Historical Background & Etymology</h2>
      <p> 
        Kolhapur’s origins trace back to <strong>mythology and early history</strong>. 
        In Hindu legend, the city is named after <strong>Kolhasur</strong>, a demon slain by Goddess Mahalaxmi (Ambabai). 
        His dying wish was to have the city named after him — hence <em>Kolha + pur</em> (city of Kolha). Scriptural references, including the <em>Devi-Bhagavata Purana</em>, describe Kolhapur (Kollapura) as the permanent abode of the goddess. 
        Stone inscriptions from the <strong>Shilahara dynasty (8th–12th century CE)</strong> refer to the city as <em>Kshullakpur</em> and <em>Kalapuri</em>, emphasizing its carved temples and Jain influence. 
        Over the centuries, the city has been known by several names: <em>Kollagiri, Kolladigiripattan, Kollpur, and Kuntal</em> (around 2 CE), all linked to its valley geography and spiritual importance.

          The Skanda Purana describes Kolhapur as the abode of Goddess Mahalaxmi (Ambabai), making it a major religious center since ancient times. 
          Archaeological findings suggest Kolhapur’s civilization dates back to at least 200 BCE, with evidence of trade and settlements.

        <summary>⚔️ Medieval Era</summary>
        <p> 
          Under the Shilahara Dynasty (940–1212 CE), Kolhapur rose to prominence as a capital city. 
          Rulers like Gandaraditya Shilahara contributed to temple construction, including portions of the Mahalaxmi Temple. 
          Later, the Yadavas of Devagiri (12th–13th century CE), under kings like Singhana II, brought Kolhapur under their influence. 
          During expansions of the Delhi Sultanate and Bahmani Sultanate, Kolhapur remained a contested but culturally resilient city, guarded by local chieftains and temple authorities.

        <summary>🦁 Maratha Period</summary>
        <p> 
          In the 17th century, Kolhapur gained importance under Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who often used Panhala Fort as a strategic stronghold. 
          The legendary Baji Prabhu Deshpande fought the heroic Battle of Pavan Khind (1660) near Kolhapur, securing Shivaji’s escape. 
          After Shivaji’s death, succession disputes created two royal seats: Satara (main line of Shivaji) and Kolhapur (younger branch of the Bhosale dynasty). 
          In 1710, Kolhapur State was formally established as a Maratha princely state, led by descendants like Chhatrapati Shahu I of Kolhapur.

        <p> The most celebrated ruler of Kolhapur was Chhatrapati Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj (1874–1922). 
          He became a pioneer of social justice, free education, and upliftment of marginalized communities. 
          He was influenced by reformers like Jyotirao Phule, and in turn, inspired later leaders such as Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. Shahu Maharaj also popularized wrestling (Kushti) and supported industrialization, leaving a permanent mark on Kolhapur’s progressive identity.

        <p> 
          During British rule, Kolhapur remained a princely state under the Bhosale dynasty, allied with the Crown but internally autonomous. 
          Leaders like Chhatrapati Shahaji II (1874–1922, contemporary with Rajarshi Shahu) maintained royal traditions alongside reforms. 
          After India’s independence in 1947, Kolhapur merged into the Indian Union.
