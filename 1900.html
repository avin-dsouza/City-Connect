  <h1>Kolhapur in the 1900s</h1>
  <p>
    After India’s independence in 1947, Kolhapur merged into the Indian Union.  
    It continued to grow as an important cultural and industrial hub.  
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1960, when Maharashtra state was formed, Kolhapur became a district headquarters,  
    known for its sugar industry, wrestling traditions, and vibrant culture.
